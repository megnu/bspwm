# megnu/ArcoLinux ArchWay bspwm scripts

These are my customized versions of the ArcoLinuxD bspwm scripts.

These scripts will install a bspwm (https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) setup with software from the Arch, AUR and ArcoLinux repos. (Remember to check the scripts before you run them!)

# 1. Start by obtaining the latest Arch Linux release

Download at https://www.archlinux.org/download/

Verify the checksums.

# 2. Follow Arch Linux installation guide

Read on the Arch Linux wiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide

Once you have the base system installed and configured you can run these scripts.

Start in the ArchWay directory and then onto the scripts here.

# 3. Run the scripts

Change the scripts to fit your use case. Uncomment/comment out lines with software that you do want/don't want installed.

Once you have checked all the scripts, you can run them.

Then you can get my config files to add to your home directory: https://github.com/megnu/arch

These scripts also work with other Arch-based distros.

If you want a simple way to install and configure your system I suggest you check out ArcoLinuxD.
